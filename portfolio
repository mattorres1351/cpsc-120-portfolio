* Lab 2

Since it was my first serious introduction to programming, Lab 2, Part 3 was one of my favorite Tabs. In high school, I took a computer science class, and although I
wrote code, it was never in a general-purpose programming language like C++. Part 3 covered the traditional process of getting "Hello world" to print on the terminal,
which many beginning programmers go through after learning the fundamentals of GitHub and Visual Studio in parts 1 and 2.

* Lab 7

Another one of my favorite labs was Lab 7, part 2, because it was one that took me a long time and a lot of effort to solve. At the same time, this was one of many
blackjack games on which I would have to work, and despite how challenging they were to create, I always enjoyed doing so. It was thrilling when I discovered what was
wrong with my program and it successfully completed all the test cases.

* Lab 9 

One of the first labs where we integrated external objects into our programs was Lab 9, part 2, which is why it is one of my personal favorites. Even while I didn't
find the lab to be particularly challenging, it gave me the opportunity to hone another important ability that I would use in the future. In this example,
we would use txt files that we would treat as a glossary of words to check if the test cases contained any misspelled words.
